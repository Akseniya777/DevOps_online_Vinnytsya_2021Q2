# Module 4. Networking Fundamentals

### After getting acquainted with the basic concepts of the network (network topology, network devices etc) and the basic features of work, I, using the network emulator - the netemul software, learned how to assemble networks, configure network cards, IP and network mask, transfer packets and check the network health. When assembling the networks, the main network devices (switch, hub, router) were used, which were interconnected by cables.

* I've put together a project that includes: 4 PCs and a Hub. Each computer was connected to a hub using a pair of wires, and assigned a unique IP address to each PC. Also have checked the functionality of the received network by making sending packets  from one PC to another:

* I've put together a project, which includes PC0-PC5, Server, 2 Hubs, connected the devices using a crossover cable, assigned IP addresses and a network mask for the PC. Then I checked the network performance by forwarding packets:

* I also created a new project, which includes: 4 PCs of the PC-PT type, and a Switch, connected the devices with each other:

* Then I expanded the project to the form: 8 PCs of the PC-PT type and 2 switches:

* and finnaly I've assmbled the project with 2 sub networks connectec to each other with Switch, and connected them using Router-PT with few ports:
